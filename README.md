1.How do I approach designing software?
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Being new to OpenGL everything was new and all of the design skills I learned were new. Learning the new design skills in OpenGL allowed me to create my 3D Scene utilizing OpenGL commands such as translate, rotate, and scale. Managing the libraries and dependencies was a dauting task at first, but over time became muscle memory.

-What design process did you follow for your project work?

My design process began with constructing the desk and going from there. Since the desk is the plane of my scene it made sense to start there. Upon the desk I placed all of the additional shapes to construct my scene. Adding multiple VAO's and VBO's allowed me to render multiple shapes seperate and together to make the scene.

-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This can be applied in everyday work. All task need a starting point, and in this case the starting point was the desk. Rather than mindlessly create shapes and try to arrange them, I created a plane to work off of. Creating figurative planes to work off of in everyday life is a good way to stay organized and focused.

2.How do I approach developing programs?
-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I didn't utilize anything new, but I did utilize development strategies I've developed throughout my time at SNHU. I applied my development strategey to OpenGL and the 3DScene. In my personal opinion, all coding is the same at it's core with language being the differnce. My development strategy varies depending on the language being used. For instance, I am much more comfortable with C++ and C rather than JS. Were I to use JS my development strategy would include much more refrences to older classes where I utilized JS.

-How did iteration factor into your development?

As I iterated through all of the modules I gained the knowledge required to fully construct the 3DScene. We learned each piece of the puzzle step by step such as applying textures one week and lighting the scene another week. This iteration was the buildup to the final project.

-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach to coding would evolve each module as I gained a new skill such as adding texture or a camera. Each module acted as a building block for the final project.

3.How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

This has been the only grahpical course I have taken so far and I don't think I'll be required to take another one. That being said I have learned a lot about graphics and visualizations and I'm interested to see how I can apply it to other fields and languages of coding.

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

While I don't want to work on graphics and visualization in the future for a living, having the knowledge of how to work on graphics makes me more valuable as a worker.
