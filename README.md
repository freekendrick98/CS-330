1.How do I approach designing software?
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Being new to OpenGL everything was new and all of the design skills I learned were new. Learning the new design skills in OpenGL allowed me to create my 3D Scene utilizing OpenGL commands such as translate, rotate, and scale. Managing the libraries and dependencies was a dauting task at first, but over time became muscle memory.

-What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process began with constructing the desk and going from there. Since the desk is the plane of my scene it made sense to start there. Upon the desk I placed all of the additional shapes to construct my scene. Adding multiple VAO's and VBO's allowed me to render multiple shapes seperate and together to make the scene.

-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This can be applied in everyday work. All task need a starting point, and in this case the starting point was the desk. Rather than mindlessly create shapes and try to arrange them, I created a plane to work off of. Creating figurative planes to work off of in everyday life is a good way to stay organized and focused.

2.How do I approach developing programs?
-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

-How did iteration factor into your development?

-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

3.How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
